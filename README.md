# Kayak-Flight-Data-Clustering
**Kayak Flight Data Clustering** is a project that scrapes flight data from Kayak and performs clustering analysis to identify the best flight deals. It uses web scraping techniques with **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** to extract real-time flight prices, durations, and airline details. After collecting the data, **Pandas** is used for cleaning and preprocessing, while **Pandas Profiling** generates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) report.

The project applies **clustering algorithms** from **Scikit-learn** to group similar flights based on price, duration, and airline preferences. Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** help analyze trends and patterns in flight prices.

This project helps users make informed travel decisions by categorizing flights into meaningful clusters, allowing them to find the best deals efficiently. Future improvements include automating the script for scheduled data collection, integrating real-time flight price tracking, and enhancing analysis with deep learning models.
